Overview of the project:

Project:SMART CITY TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Smart Traffic Sensors
IoT sensors provide the backbone of data that intelligent transportation management systems analyze to increase actionable insights. Smart traffic management systems use integrated sensors like:

Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags
Automatic identification and data collection (AIDC) tags
Temperature sensors
Air quality sensors
With amount of data that ITS generate, it’s crucial that the system integrates cloud computing and edge processing.

Connected Video Monitoring
One of the main technological aspects of smart traffic management systems is video detection systems with integrated edge processing. Connected video monitoring solutions within the realm of traffic safety are referred to as traffic incident management systems (TIMs). A TIM allows city planners to gain real-time insights on regarding traffic conditions and respond to incidents through HD footage, image detection, and image recognition.

Connected Traffic Light Systems
As opposed to conventional traffic lights, smart traffic light systems integrate the aforementioned sensor and connected video monitoring technologies to account for intersection wait times, vehicle speed, and/or pedestrian traffic. Intelligent traffic light systems incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) processes to enable computer vision, optical character recognition (OCR), and reinforcement learning

Conclusion:
This Project presents a solution to deal with traffic congestion in metropolitan cities and presents a central traffic control system which runs on a pretty simple algorithm. Our product would include the entire mechanism of detection of congestion and increasing the red light duration of traffic signals in the crossings
